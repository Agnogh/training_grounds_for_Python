"# venvmodule" 
# Battle grounds

## This is imporvised RPG that has turn-base gameplay
## You have 10 player characters and 5 enemies (selection is possible for your heroes, weapons and monsters)
## Follow on screen instructions to get the idea what is this about


### This is the best I could pull off considering time tables at Code Institute are merciless same as my bosses at work

### I put way more time than expected after redoing the project, but I loved doing it. Connecting to spreadsheet was pain as I (again) exposed the keys so I had to nuke the sheet and start over

### Other setback was with Heroku deployment that is really easy but for some reason I got stuck on it for several hours

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 26, 2025**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
